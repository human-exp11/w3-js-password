Password Generator



***Password Generator:*** When asked to create a Password Generator with given index.html & style.css files, I utilized JavaScript to meet all of the acceptance criteria.

## Completed Steps:

* Applied a Query Selector to the generate id associated with the generateBtn variable
* Assigned passwrod criteria to four different variables (special characters, lower case, upper case, & numbers)
* Applied a Query Selector to the password id within the text area
* Created a userLength function that prompted question to user
* Used if, else if, & else to keep password length within the parameters of 8-128 characters
* Alerted user to choose more or less characters depending on input
* Created a followUp function that used confirm to ask user if they would like to include specific character types
* Utilized concatination to add on accepted characters to the user's password
* Created a generatePassword function with a For Loop that used Math.random to populate a random password based off of the character length & character types the user chose
* Added  Event Listenter that is associated with the event "click" and the function writePassword
* Created README file with link & screenshot
